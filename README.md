> The web interface for [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)

IPFS Webui is a web interface for IPFS, the Interplanetary File System. With the interface, you can check on your node info, network addresses, see connections on a globe visually, see your files, look at your config and logs without needing to touch the CLI, and more. This interface uses the [js-ipfs-api](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-api) for all of its heavy lifting.

The webui is a **work-in-progress**. Follow the [development](#development) processes below to check it out.

Otherwise, if you're curious about IPFS, head over to [ipfs/ipfs](//github.com/ipfs/ipfs), or to the [golang](//github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) or [nodejs](//github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) implementations. The [website](https://ipfs.io) also has a host of resources on how to get started.

## Development

Make sure [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) are installed and in your path.

### Config

When developing the WebUI you will need an ipfs daemon running with API access on port `5001`, as well as the following configuration set, otherwise you will not be able to communicate with the ipfs node.

```bash
$ ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '["http://localhost:3000"]'
$ ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods '["PUT", "GET", "POST"]'
$ ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Credentials '["true"]'
```

### Installation and running

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ipfs/webui
$ cd webui
$ npm install
# Runs server on port 3000.
$ npm start
```

### Resetting

To reset your config back to the default configuration, run the following command.

```sh
$ ipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders {}
```

It might be a good idea to copy the `.ipfs/config` file somewhere with a useful name so you can use `ipfs config replace <file>` to switch between dev mode easily.

## Building

```bash
$ npm run build
# The result will be in /dist
```
